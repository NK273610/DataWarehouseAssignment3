# DataWarehouseAssignment3

In this assignment we first created temp.py file which trains three models from Tweets.csv data and saves the model. Here for all the three models we have used Logistic Regression but for first model we have used CountVectorizer, for second one we used Word2Vec and for third one we have used TFIDF. We then created the pipeline and fir the csv data to it. We then save all the models in respective folders.

We have then checked the accuracy for each of the models on our test data created from Tweets.csv data. Based on this we have selected the model with highest accuracy i.e. Logistic Regression with CountVectorizer. In order to train our models please run file using the below commands. Please check we have used Python 2.7 in our assignments.

```
##python temp.py
```
